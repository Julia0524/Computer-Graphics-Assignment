Computer Graphics Assignment2: Ray Tracing
Xinyi Yu

Codes for ray tracing: 
1. main.cpp
2. Vector3.h: definition and implementation of class Vector3
3. Object.h: definition and implementation of several object classes(Sphere, Cube, Model)
4. Ray.h: implementation of tracing and rendering

Finished work:
1. Ray trace and correctly draw a sphere object in the scene
2. Ray trace and correctly draw a cube object in the scene
3. Ray trace and correctly draw a model object in the scene
4. Correctly perform Phong shading
5. Display shadows
6. Correctly perform recursive reflection

Unfinished work:
1. Texture mapping

The result screenshot is in the 'images' folder.
Models used in the program is in the 'model' folder.
